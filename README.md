# 🌱 ESP32 Environmental Variable Capture

Welcome! This repository contains code examples and projects for capturing environmental variables using the ESP32 microcontroller.

## 🚀 Overview

With the ESP32, you can measure and log important environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and more. This project aims to provide easy-to-use code for beginners and enthusiasts interested in environmental monitoring.

## ✨ Features

- Measure temperature and humidity 🌡️💧
- Read air quality sensors 🌬️
- Log and visualize data 📊
- Modular and easy-to-understand code

## 🚦 Usage

1. Connect the sensors to the ESP32 as described in the wiring diagrams (coming soon!).
2. Flash the code to your ESP32.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to see live readings.

## 📚 Documentation

- Example codes are provided in the `/examples` directory.
- Sensor pin configurations and details are explained in the code comments.
